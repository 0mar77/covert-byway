- This project was built with security in mind. To help users protect their information from hackers
- This project was built to solve the issue of weak passwords. With our technology, we can create strong passwords that are hard to hack

Many different ideas were attempted but ultimately failed. Getting to the end result was a long and strenuous journey but also fulfilling and exciting, to be able to solve.
